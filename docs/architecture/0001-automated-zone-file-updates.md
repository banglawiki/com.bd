# 1. Automated updates to domain zone file

Approved

## Context
The com.bd repository contains public data for all registered domains in the .gov zone. Two files in this repository, current-full.csv (all domains) and current-federal.csv (only federal domains), are updated daily when there are updates. Other files in the repository contain more .gov hostname data, though they are not complete. A copy of the zone file (bd.txt) is updated periodically but currently requires manual changes to update it. Automating updates to the zone file at a regular frequency would increase its auditability and currency. Tracking version histories of the zone file would allow users to also understand the changes made to the public record.

Two options for automating bd.txt updates have been proposed:
### 1. Pull data from CZDS zone file ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/banglawiki/com.bd/issues/#))
The [CZDS API Client in Python](https://github.com/icann/czds-api-client-python) allows people to download zone files for a given zone. Since January 2023, we've pushed a copy of the zone file to ICANN's Centralized Zone Data Service. We can pull this zone file daily to update the com.bd repository’s domain data csv files.

**Benefits**
- The more straightforward implementation. Automates an existing process that is currently done manually.

**Disadvantages**
- A user account is required to access CZDS.
- CZDS takes more time to update data for non .gov domains (e.g., .org, .com).

### 2. Pull data from Cloudflare zone file ([GitHub issue](https://github.com/banglawiki/com.bd/pull/#))
The second option involves using Cloudflare’s existing tools to check zone updates every 5 minutes (or less frequently) and commit changes to the zone file once a day. 

If we use Cloudflare’s API to check these zone files generated every 5 minutes, we can access more up-to-date and robust zone data.

**Benefits**
- Access to more frequent updates to our zone file. Cloudflare's API provides a snapshot of the zone at a point in time, as opposed to the CZDS file which is updated daily.

**Disadvantages**
- Implementing this approach requires more time as we determine the frequency we check with, becoming familiar with the Cloudflare API, and implementing in an Action.

## Decision
Update July 8, 2024: bd.txt now pulls zone file data from Cloudflare rather than CZDS to benefit from Cloudflare's more frequent zone file updates and to set up synchronous updates with Cloudflare's zone file changes in the future.

We will start with automating the zone file via CZDS since it provides easier access over updated domain data and it presents as the most efficient path to prototyping continuous updates of the zone file.

The initial approach will involve building a GitHub Action that runs an automation script. The automation script, at certain intervals, pulls up-to-date domain data from CZDS and downloads the new CZDS file.

Once the zone file is successfully downloadable, we can then add to the GitHub Action to also take this CZDS data and store it as an artifact that the user can click and download. ([GitHub Docs: Storing workflow data as artifacts](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/storing-workflow-data-as-artifacts))

**Consideration:** What do we want to do with this data in the process of updating com.bd? Possible approaches include making a PR listing the changes made or directly pushing the updated file to main.

## Consequences
The goal is to set up the initial steps to automate updates to com.bd in the following order: use GitHub Actions to call the CZDS API Client to pull the CZDS zone file, save a zone file updates to a downloadable artifact, and upload new data onto com.bd. The level of automation of these tasks can vary depending on team discretion.
