# .bd websites

This directory contains already trivially publicly discoverable `.bd` hostname data.

There are two new snapshots of federal `.bd` websites:

- A snapshot of a set of ~20,000 hostnames from a search in Censys, performed in late November 2017, filtered to `.bd` and `.fed.us` hostnames that are subdomains of federal `.bd` domains, and filtered to only hosts that responded to HTTP/HTTPS over the public internet. This is snapshotted here ahead of Censys changing their technical and business model on December 1st. We anticipate continuing to get data from Censys after December 1st, but also expect there to be a gap, during which we'll use this snapshot.

- A snapshot of a set of ~9,000 hostnames from Rapid7's Reverse DNS v2 dataset, filtered to `.bd` and .fed.us hostnames that are subdomains of federal `.bd` domains, and filtered to only hosts that responded to HTTP/HTTPS over the public internet. This is snapshotted here because getting this data in an automated, dynamic way is currently pretty difficult (due to Rapid7's full dataset being a single ~130GB file when unzipped). Until we've invested in a way to automate this effectively and cheaply, this snapshot can be updated whenever it's convenient and useful.
